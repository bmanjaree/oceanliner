    "## OceanHackWeek21 project to subsample high-resolution model output as if by gliders, ships, or other *in situ* platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a Python package that takes an input trajectory (e.g., the path of an ocean glider or a ship-based underway CTD), subsamples output from a high-resolution ocean simulation along that trajectory, and returns a set of subsampled variables (e.g., standard physical variables temperature, salinity, velocity; derived physical quantities such as steric height; biogeochemical quantities if available). We envision this package having two potential uses: 1) designing in situ sampling strategies, and 2) interpreting in situ data in the context of a highly resolved oceanographic model."
