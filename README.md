## Notebook to subsample high-resolution model output as if by gliders, ships, or other in situ platforms

This package that takes an input trajectory (e.g., the path of an ocean glider), subsamples output from a high-resolution ocean simulation along that trajectory, and returns a set of subsampled variables (e.g., standard physical variables temperature, salinity, velocity; derived physical quantities such as steric height; biogeochemical quantities if available).  We envision this package having two potential uses: 1) designing *in situ* sampling strategies, and 2) interpreting *in situ* data in the context of a high resolution model.

This project started during OceanHackWeek21.  FinalProjectSummary.ipynb contains the final project notebook developed during OHW21; Individual notebooks that went into FinalProjectSummary.ipynb are in the OHW21_code folder.
