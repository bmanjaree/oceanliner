**Oceanliner Documentation**
======================================

Introduction
------------


This package is being developed as part of a NASA-funded SWOT Science Team project to develop tools for planning in situ oceanographic campaigns that will take place after SWOT's launch, notably as part of the Adopt-a-Crossover program.
It takes an input trajectory (e.g., the path of an ocean glider), subsamples output from a high-resolution ocean simulation along that trajectory, and returns a set of subsampled variables (e.g., standard physical variables temperature, salinity, velocity; derived physical quantities such as steric height; biogeochemical quantities if available). 
We envision this package having two potential uses: 1) designing in situ sampling strategies, and 2) interpreting in situ data in the context of a high resolution model.
